I've been taking notes on my build process.  Here's what I logged so far:

download and install mingw32

- download MinGW-1.1.tar.gz from http://www.mingw.org/download.shtml
- install as directed; make sure that mingw-1.1\bin is in your PATH
- note: I installed mine in \mingw-1.1\

download, compile and install zlib

- download source code from http://www.gzip.org/zlib/
- note: I placed mine in \projects\zlib\ 
  (rename directory zlib-1.1.4\ to zlib\)
- make -f nt\makefile.gcc
- copy libz.a to \mingw-1.1\lib\

download, compile and install libpng

- download source code from http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html
- note: I placed mine in \projects\lpng24\
- make -f scripts\makefile.gcc
- copy png.h to \mingw-1.1\include\
- copy libpng.a to \mingw-1.1\lib\

download and install glut headers and libraries

- download glheaders.zip from ldglite page
- move .lib files to \mingw-1.1\lib\
- move .h files to \mingw-1.1\include\GL\

download and compile ldglite

- download ldglitesrc0_9_5.zip from ldglite page
- note: I put mine in \projects\ldglite\
- note: I had to recompile libpng and libz because I kept getting a linker
  error for "__imp__iob"
- delete the files in the ldglite\win directory.  It's older png stuff.
- not necessary, but you may want to change the "cp ldglite.exe *" commands
  to "copy ldglite.exe *"
- make
