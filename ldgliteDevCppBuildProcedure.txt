I created a ldglite.dev file to build ldglite with the Dev-C++ compiler
IDE version 4.9.8.5.  Here are some build notes.

I had to make a few changes to get it to work though.  Apparently this
version of mingw comes with a buggy make.exe program.  I had to replace
it with a slightly older one that I got from somewhere (MSYS?) to get it 
to work.  Run "make --version" to see what you've got.  Version 3.79.1 
supplied with Dev-C++ mangles quoted paths resulting in "syntax error: 
unexpected end of file" message.  Make.exe version 3.78.1 worked for me.
If you can build the hello example that comes with Dev-C++ then you 
should be OK.  See this make bug report for more details.

I downloaded the Dev-C++ image libraries DevPak to get the png and zlib
libraries.  You can do this from the "Tools/Check for Updates/Packages"
menu in Dev_C++.

I also had to install glut.h in the Dev-cpp/include/gl directory.  It
comes with the glut library, but not the header file.  Weird.

At this point you should be able to build ldglite.
